# A Simple BlueZ Agent for IoT

I specifically use this BlueZ agent on my sound system, which is Linux-powered
and Bluetooth-connected. Really, it's just a BlueZ agent with a web interface
so pairing/connecting can be done without being near the device, as long as
both devices are connected to the same network.

Yocto recipes are available in the `meta-edtwardy` layer on GitHub.
